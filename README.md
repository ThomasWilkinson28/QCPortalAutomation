# QCPortalAutomation
For this project I improved an in house software tool at Giatec Scientific Inc. by modyfying the front-end layout using Dash libraries and the back-end database interactions using SQLAlchemy. Once complate, the improved tool saves countless hours of data insertion for the QC team when logging their test results.
